Scripts for running the population synchrony analyses. 

1. UKBMS_synchrony: Read in population and climate synchrony data for each of the 701 UKBMS site for 32 species. The script runs models for average synchrony and temporal trends in synchrony for 3 movement-related attributes: specialism, mobility and population abundance. 

2. BBS_synchrony: as above, but using the BTO Breeding Bird Survey data for 24 species at 2,499 sites

3. CBC_synchrony: as above, but using the BTO Common Birds Census data for 26 species at 108 sites
